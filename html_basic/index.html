    <h1>Welcome to My First Portfolio</h1>

    <p>Hello! I'm excited to share my first web page with you. This site is part of my journey into web development.</p>

    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. My goal is to become a full-stack developer and create useful, beautiful web applications.</p>

    <h3>Projects</h3>
    <p>This is just the beginning. Soon, Iâ€™ll be adding links to my projects, GitHub repositories, and more interactive elements.</p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting my page. Stay tuned for updates and improvements!</p>
